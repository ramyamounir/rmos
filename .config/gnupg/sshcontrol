# List of allowed ssh keys. Only keys present in this file are used in the SSH
# protocol. The ssh-add tool may add new entries to this file to enable them;
# you may also add them manually. Comment lines, like this one, as well as empty
# lines are ignored. Lines do have a certain length limit but this is not
# serious limitation as the format of the entries is fixed and checked by
# gpg-agent. A non-comment line starts with optional white spaces, followed by
# the keygrip of the key given as 40 hex digits, optionally followed by a
# caching TTL in seconds, and another optional field for arbitrary flags.
# Prepend the keygrip with an '!' mark to disable it.
